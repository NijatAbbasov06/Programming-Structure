No it is not possible because we cannot find the memory from the pointer
value. Assert only gives error if the expression is False. So we would need to know the size of the Dest by only having information about a pointer that
points to Dest. Becuase it is not possible, answer is no.

Yes, I used pointer notation.

3 days. I could not focus :(.

Very good, I really enjoyed it.

No idea. Could not find any bugs, thank you for your time.
