I used these materials to learn the meanings of the columns in
(gdb) info registers:

I spent 3 days on this assignment 2 days was because I could not find from where segmentation error was coming. By using jmp .quit, I finally detected it was from scanf. After using info registers command of gdb, it was much easier to debug other parts of my code.  


It was a really enjoyable problem, but I think, in the lectures, it was less clear how we can use scanf and printf functions, also, what 16 byte alignment for rsp means. In my opinion, it would be great to show some examples of using printf and scanf, and some potential faults coming from them in the lectures. Also, it would be great to explain 16 byte alignment. It was my first time using Assembly, and these topics were really hard for me to grasp.
